# Customer-churn-prediction
This project predicts **customer churn** (whether a customer will leave the service or not) using machine learning models. 


## Features of the Project
- **Data Preprocessing**  
  - Handled missing values  
  - Encoded categorical variables  
  - Normalized features  

- **Class Balancing**  
  - Tested balancing (SMOTE/oversampling) but observed overfitting due to duplicate rows.  

- **Feature Selection**  
  - Selected the most important features  
  - Achieved similar accuracy but with **less computational power**  


- **Evaluation Metrics**  
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
  - Confusion Matrix + Heatmap
